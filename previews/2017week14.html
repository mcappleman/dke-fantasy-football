                <p>
                    Well there we have it. After a hard fought year, we now know who made it into the playoffs with a shot at making some money,
                    and who is playing for pride.
                    <b>FUCK YOU WILLIS!!!</b> Hunter has taken over Sawyer's position as the luckiest team so far this year.
                    And damn I feel bad for Sawyer, he should have easily waltzed into the playoffs after starting 6-0. Instead
                    he lost 7 games in a row and landed himself in 9th place with the possibility of getting the Sacko...
                    Rough... All he had to do was win and he would be in the playoffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there are a few things that stand out to me right now. Remember when Majors bitched about how his team was terrible...
                    Yeah... You had just a terrible team Majors... Also look at Basil, he thought that his season was over
                    two weeks ago and finally accepted that he could not fake his way into liking Texas. So naturally, after
                    feeling like all hope of his season was lost, he went bad to his roots. TexasSucks returned, and so did
                    Basil's season. So far 2-0 with Texas hate, and 5-5-1 when pretending to like Texas. Will Basil be able
                    to carry that momentum into the playoffs? There is definitely a chance with it looking like Discount
                    Double Check making his return next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I threw all my chips into this season when I made that trade for Mike Evans, giving up my first round and Abdullah.
                    I really liked my team after that, thinking I had two stud receivers and still plenty of RBs to carry
                    me into the playoffs easily... Nope, now I have to find a way to make sure that I come in 7th place and
                    hope that I play Sawyer in the best of the rest game. That way Basil doesn't get too many high draft
                    picks next year. Still, I am interested to see how next year's draft will play out. We have never seen
                    anyone have 3 first round draft picks, and will there be anybody really worth those first round picks
                    after all the keepers. Knowing Basil, my bet is that all 3 of his first rounders will be definitive reaches,
                    like taking Paul Perkins in the first...
                </p>

                <h2 id="funfact">Fun Fact of the Week</h2>

                <p>
                    This week's fun fact is brought to you by this Florida Man who just wanted <a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/blogs/off-the-beat/2017/12/05/hey-officer-you-wanna-smoke-joint-me/871121001/">to smoke a joint with a cop.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    All jokes aside, this week I want to talk about how everyone has done in the past regular seasons. The only person whose playoff streak has come to an end is Ross, being replaced by Trevor this year. This is also the first time that Trevor has ever made the playoffs. Congrats buddy, I have more good news for you later, so stay tuned. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let's take a look at the seedings for the previous years first, then you can look at the second table to determine when your best regular season was and which one was your worst. 
                </p>

                <div class="overflow-auto">
                    <h3>Seedings</h3>
                    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive" id="seeds"></table>
                </div>

                <div class="overflow-auto">
                    <h3>Best Seeds</h3>
                    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive" id="best"></table>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So first things first, in 2011 we only had 10 teams and only the top 4 teams went to the playoffs. Therefore there were no bye weeks except that the season was over for the 9th and 10th seed. Also when we had 14 teams in 2013, the 13th and 14th seeds were done for the season but the top 6 made the playoffs, and the next 6 made the consolation bracket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here are 6 fun facts, 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Majors has been a top 3 seed every year except twice. One of those was a top 4 seed though, so still pretty damn good.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Jared and Trevor have never been a top 4 seed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When I have made the playoffs, I have been a 1 or 2 seed, never anything less. On the flipside, I have been the 7th seed 3 out the past 4 years, including this year and last year...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Basil has either made the playoffs or been the 11th seed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Here is the good news for Trevor, the past 3 years, the 5th seed has won it all. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The 1st, 4th, and 6th seed have never won the championship.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <div class="matchup" id="game1">
                    <h3>Turd Ferguson vs TexasSucks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rematch. Basil got the better of Willis' weak ass team last week to get himself into the playoffs. That win even up the series between Basil and Willis at 3 a piece. Actually, I really shouldn't blame Willis, I should blame Julio for his lackluster performance last week. Julio has been pretty underwhelming all year, except two weeks ago. He has only scored double digit fantasy points 4 times this year. Although, he does play the Saints so he should show up if the Falcons want to make the playoffs. On the other hand, Basil will be hoping that his RBs can do enough to get him past this week so that he can play Jordy and Aaron together again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that the Eagles are going to show up in LA and shut down the Rams. Therefore, I don't think that the Goff, Kupp, and the Rams D will do much for Willis, and it should be another good week for Wentz. Give me Basil in this one to move on to the semis.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="matchup" id="game2">
                    <h3>'99 Bills vs Excel-sior</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gronk's stupid hit after the whistle is really going to haunt a lot of fantasy owners this week, and that includes Trevor. Although Brate should be a nice fill in for this week. That should give Sam a nice chance to get a win and pull this series back a little closer. Currently Trevor has beaten Sam 4 out the 6 times that they have met, including week 11 of this year. So far the winner of this series has scored over 100 points except for once, when Sam scored 99.92 points. Trevor might be in for a rough week with the Jags playing Seattle, who just shut down the high flying Eagles, and I don't think that Drake will be able to find too much running room against the Patriots. In addition, if Stafford throws a touchdown, it will most likely go to either Tate or Marvin Jones Jr. Both are in Sam's starting lineup this week, which will benefit him more than Trevor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am going to go with Sam in this one because Brady is going to go into Miami and torch the Dolphins. In addition, I think that Hill and the KC offense will roll against the Raiders since Reid gave up the playcalling to Matt Naggy. How about that name, "My name is Naggy, Matt." Sorry Trevor but the 5 seed champions streak ends this year.
                    </p>

                    <h3>It's Frommplicated vs Le'Veon A Prayer</h3>
                    <p>
                        On to the consolation bracket. Ross has gotten the better of Chaz the past two time that they have met but they both have 3 wins in this series. Yet, Ross has only averaged 77.9 points against Chaz. Ross will be hoping for better if he wants to beat Chaz and avoid playing in the Sacko bowl. Which he shouldn't have too much troubles this week with Alfred Morris and Dez playing the Giants, who finally fired their coach and GM. Although, Charles Clay and LeSean McCoy have an extremely favorable matchup against the Colts at home. This game should be one to watch this week.
                    </p>

                        I am going to go with Chaz this week. LeSean should have an absolute field day making defenders look silly and Keenan Allen looks like a stud and should get plenty of targets against a middle of the pack Redskins secondary. Plus, Matt Ryan and the Falcons will have to show up at home against the Saints.

                    <h3>Premature Punishment vs DeMarco Polo</h3>
                    <p>
                       So far Sawyer has beaten Jared 6 out of 9 times. Jared has typically played pretty well against Sawyer, only failing to score 80 points twice, and only failing to score 90 points 3 times. On the other hand though, Sawyer must be relieved with how well Cam has played. Cam has only failed to post 20 or more points in 3 of the last 9 games. Jared does have some intriguing receivers starting. Josh Gordon and DeSean Jackson are both boom or bust players and Cooper should be a WR1 but has been pretty disappointing this season. Talk about disappointments, Sawyer has got to be disappointed with the production from Doug Martin. He started out looking like the Muscle Hamster of old but that quickly changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am going to take Sawyer in this game because it is hard to choose a team where the second highest projected player is your kicker.
