            different 4 game losing streaks.

            <h3>SIN-CLAIRR!!!! vs ReturnOfGatorFuckers</h3>
            <p>
              Here we go again. Another game between Majors and Trevor. Trevor
              still has only beaten Majors twice and Majors is riding a 4 game
              win streak over Trevor. Higher stakes in this matchup though due
              to the fact that the winner goes to the championship. Majors
              should be thanking his lucky stars that he is getting Kamara back
              this week but Wentz's injury surely hurts Agholor's value. Trevor
              will be getting Gronk back but Fournette has a Quad injury that
              could impact the amount of touches he gets on Sunday. Even if
              Fournette sits, Lamar Miller should get some value seeing how the
              way to attack the Jags defense is by running it down their
              throats.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to go with Trevor and Gronk this week. Stafford should
              light up the Bears, Adams will enjoy having Rodgers back, and I am
              betting that the Jags defense gets a touchdown.

            <h3>Grab Em By The Percy vs TexasSucks</h3>
            <p>
              Basil has not beaten Hunter since week 16 last year and is now on
              the losing side of this series at 3-4-1. Hunter and Basil have
              both put up triple digits in their past three games against one
              another and I can see that trend continuing. Basil will be
              rejoicing the return of Rodgers right in time as Wentz went down
              last week. Although, Basils runningbacks situation is pretty
              bleak. The Giants reportedly want to get Gallman more touches and
              I have no faith in anyone on the Jets offense with Bryce Petty
              being the QB. Hunter is still going with the Pittsburgh defense
              even though they are playing Brady & co. Good luck with that one
              sir. I think that game will be a shoot out.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to go with Hunter in this one because Basil will need a
              miracle from Rodgers in order to carry his RBs. Let's go Steelers!
              Plus if Pittsburgh and the Jags win, then the Pats and Jags are
              tied for 2nd in the AFC with 10 wins... Who would have predicted
              that!

            <h3>You Feel Lucky Punk? vs Le'Veon a Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Ross will be looking to continue his winning streak this week and
              also take control of our series. Currently we are tied 3-3,
              trading wins in every game. I won the last one in week 4 so that
              probably means that Ross will beat me this time. Russell Wilson
              has been amazing since his week 6 bye, scoring more than 24 points
              all but once when he scored only 19.42 points. Dez has started to
              get back on track as well with touchdowns in his last two games.
              Ross is 4-2 when Dez scored a touchdown this season. I decided to
              go with Nick Foles this week hoping that he can regain his form
              when he was with Philly in 2013. Also I am hoping that Rodgers
              return only helps Jamaal Williams find even more running room.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to pick myself to win this matchup even though Hopkins
              is playing the Jags defense. I like my team more than Ross' team.

            <h3>Turd Ferguson vs Excel-sior</h3>
            <p>
              Willis has won the past two games against Sam and holds a slight
              edge of 5 wins to Sam's 4 wins. These two will be battling for the
              last time this season so you might as well go out with a win. Who
              would have guessed that Brady & co would have been beaten by the
              Dolphins? Not I. Anyways, they will have a much tougher matchup
              this week playing in Pittsburgh but like I said earlier, I expect
              that to be a high scoring game. So Brady and Dion Lewis should
              have some nice games. On the other hand, Kareem Hunt finally
              return to the endzone last week for Willis but the Chargers
              defense will be a lot tougher than the Raiders. I really like Goff
              this week though against a beaten up Seattle defense. I mean
              Bortles looked like a quality QB last week against them and Goff
              is better than Bortles.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am taking Sam and Brady & co in this one. You just don't bet
              against Brady, especially in big games.

            <h3>Premature Punishment vs Hairy Palmers</h3>
            <p>
              Sawyer and Ean have only met 6 times and Sawyer leads 4-2 with a 4
              game win streak over Ean. Sawyer has put up triple digits in each
              of the past 3 games he played Ean. Sawyer has a good shot of that
              with Denver's defense looking like Denver's defense again last
              week, not to mention they play probably the worst offense in the
              NFL this week, the Colts. In addition, Rivers is finally targeting
              Hunter Henry, who has 5 plus targets in the last 4 weeks. Henry
              has a touchdown in two of his last three games to go along with
              those targets. On the other hand, Ean has quarterbacks. Four of
              them to be exact.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going with Ean and his four quarterbacks in this one. Travis
              Kelce should get his against the Chargers because he might be the
              only option. Also Sexy Rexy will continue to vulture touchdowns.

            <h3>It's Frommplicated vs DeMarco Polo</h3>
            <p>
              The Sacko Bowl. Jared will be looking to avoid finishing in last
              place the for second year in a row and fourth time overall.
              Meanwhile, Chaz will be hoping to not finish in last place for the
              first time. These two have only played each other 3 times and
              Jared currently holds a 2-1 lead over Chaz. Neither team has yet
              to put up triple digits against the other. Will that change this
              week? Chaz has some really nice players this week. Matt Ryan is
              playing an abysmal Bucs secondary and McCoy probably won't get 32
              carries again but he should still get a heavy workload on that
              offense. Whereas Jared has Dak who has a decent matchup against an
              average Oakland secondary and Josh Gordon has returned nicely for
              the Browns. In addition, Jared gets Ertz back this week and he
              should be a nice safety blanket for Foles. Also the Giants have
              given up 11 touchdowns to TEs this year, and Cleveland is second
              giving up 9 touchdowns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to take Chaz in this game, sorry Jared. Keenan Allen
              should continue to soak up targets and yards as the Chargers look
              to win the AFC West. I mean he has 13+ targets in 3 of his last 4,
              100+ yards in his last 4, and 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games.
              Also if Matty Ice can't put up big numbers against the Bucs, then
              I don't know if he can put up big numbers...
